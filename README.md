# Cryptocurrencies

The objectives in this analysis were to:
* Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
* Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
* Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
* Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
* Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.

The final deliverable for this analysis is a report that includes an analysis of cryptocurrencies  on a trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for investment banking clients.
